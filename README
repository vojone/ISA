# ISA project - Feedreader

## Author
Vojtěch Dvořák (xdvora3o)

## Creation date
23. 10. 2022

## About
Reader of news in Atom/RSS2.0 format with TLS support. Reads XML documents specified by URLs and prints their content in format defined by the project assignment. It is designed to be robust and modular. For details see `manual.pdf`.

## Structure of project
- `tests` - folder with test cases 

- `tests_serverside` - folder with documents, that are places on HTTP server: `http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz`, that provides stub for some "online" tests (this source static in contrast with real feed sources)

- `cli.h, cli.c` - CLI module, performs communication with user

- `common.h, common.c` - module with auxiliary functions used across the project (e. g. dynamic string)

- `feed.h, feed.c` - module for parsing of RSS2.0/ATOM document and printing result to the stdout

- `feedreader.h`, `feedreader.c` - main of the program

- `feedreadertest.sh` - test script for program

- `http.h, http.c` - module with function, that performs HTTP(S) connection and fetching, checking and parsing data via HTTP(S)

- `url.h, url.c` - module that is reponsible for processing of URLs

- `Makefile` - project Makefile

- `README` - this file

- `manual.pdf` - project documentation


## Libraries and dependencies
Program uses following standard libraries for C language:
`stdio.h`
`stdlib.h`
`stdbool.h`
`stdarg.h`
`string.h`
`ctype.h`
`sys`
`time.h`
`strings.h`
`errno.h`
`poll.h`
`regex.h`


Program is also dependent on these libraries:

`libxml2` - necessary for parsing XML (see `feed` module)

`openssl` - it is used for fetching data through HTTP(S)

For testing it is neccessary to have `bash` installed.

## Usage
Use `make` (or `make debug`) command to compile the program and create the binary. Then test of the program can be executed by `make test` or it can be executed by following scheme: 

Usage:

`./feedreader <URL | -f <feedfile>> [OPTIONS]`

- `URL`   URL address of source (accepted schemes: `http://`, `https://`, `file://`)

- `-f feedfile`     defines path to feedfile with URLs, fomat of feedfile is defined by the project assignment

Options:
- `-h`, `--help`    Prints help to std output and then terminates the program 

- `-c certfile`   Defines path to the file with certificates, that will be used for verification of server certificate

- `-C certaddr`   Defines path to the folder with certificates, that will be used for verification of server certificate (there may be need tu run c_rehash utility above `certaddr` first)

- `-T`  Activates priting of last update time

- `-a`  Activates printing of author name  

- `-u`  Activates printing of associated URL


## Examples
Simple reading of one RSS source:
```
./feedreader http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
```

Reading multiple sources (Atom and RSS) specified in feedfile:
```
./feedreader -f example_feedfile1

## Extensions
- Support of HTTP redirection (if program got 3xx status code, redirects user to the new adress given by `Location:` header)

- `file://` URL scheme (reading from file given by absolute path)

- Percent encoding of URL path - if there are any characters that are not allowed by the RFC3986, they should converted to the percent encoded equivalent (but **all user inputs must be in UTF-8**) 

## Limitations
Except of library dependencies (just compilation dependency), input encoding - UTF-8 (if the URLs are not formated properly) and the neccesity to run c_rehash above `certaddr` (it is caused by OpenSSL implementation). The program **does not have any other limitation**.
